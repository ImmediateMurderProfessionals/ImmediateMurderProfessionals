Absolutely insane visually, to the point where I could not believe it was made in the Geometry Dash editor, much less in only the 50 editor hours that it purports to have been made in. However, I agree with everything PAHC said; the level gives me huge "You don't matter, give up" vibes, and is just terrible conceptually, as he said. With that said, I can't give this a 0; it's ridiculously good visually, and I LOVE space, and I'm also lowkey pretty impressed by the sheer audacity Pb207 had to make such a beautiful looking level with such a disgusting and harmful concept.



Might write more about this in the future, but for now, enjoy this 1/10.



Edit 7/30/2025: I read Pb207's response, and so should you. I understand all of what he said, and I forgive him. Will keep this review up though but mostly only for archival purposes. Will probably move it to a different site in a few hours though.


This review has been archived on GitHub because Pb207, the level's creator, was not intending to have such a disgusting concept, and has contacted an elder moderator to get the level removed from the servers. I accept his apology.
