So let’s say, you, Incidius, Vesuvius, Sudasu, and Devilmine are going on a walk together when a truck hits all five of you. A few hours later, you and your friends wake up and find out you have been isekai’d into the opulent castle of Chenuvik. You cannot escape from the castle, and even if you could there’s seemingly no way to get back to the real world.

All that’s left for the five of you to do is just explore the castle. You do this for a bit, remarking on how beautiful the castle is and how strange it is that there is no one else in the castle, until Incidius’s tail gets stuck in a glob of slime. After spending about half an hour freeing him, you continue to explore, eventually making it to a room with sixteen giant buttons in a 4x4 grid. Once you enter the room, the door behind you is replaced with wall, sealing the five of you in the room.

The owner of the castle appears in the corner of the room, and reveals himself to be WKGames. He announces that of the sixteen buttons in the room, only one button will lead to the five of you getting sent back to the real world. The other buttons have the following effects:
- One button sends your group back to the real world, but infects you all with terminal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which will kill you within a year.
- One button does absolutely nothing.
- One button turns all of you into paintings, which are displayed on the walls of the castle.
- One button traps your souls in Alastor’s radio forever.
- One button throws the five of you into a giant blender and makes a smoothie.
- One button turns you and your friends into the castle’s maids.
- One button spawns Zain Ahmed, who will kill all of you.
- One button spawns Waboo, who will kill all of you faster.
- One button simply makes the five of you vanish.
- One button cooks the five of you into a yummy feast, which WKGames and his friends eat for dinner.
- One button turns your group into Italian brainrot characters.
- One button turns all of you into more buttons.
- One button fuses all of you together into a weird monster that immediately explodes and dies.
- One button turns the five of you into golden statues, which are displayed in the throne room.
- One button combines the negative effects of every other button and inflicts them upon Devilmine, while the rest of your group gets to go home.

You do not know which button corresponds to each effect, and you can only press one. And you have to press one within five minutes, otherwise you and your buddies will be sent to super hell for 127252162 years. You can, however, try to bargain for information on which button is which from WKGames.

What do you think WKGames will want in exchange for giving you more information?
