The Geometry Dash level "BombCraft Extended" by BCMGF1137 is full of complete bullshit. I will debunk all the false claims in the level pretty soon, so stay tuned.

And also Blue's doxxing was NOT done with malicious intent, I WAS TRYING TO FUCKING COMPLIMENT HIM, so STOP CALLING ME A DOXXER >:(

I don't hate anyone or any group of people for who they are, I may hate a person or group of people for their actions, but usually, when it's a group, I don't hate the entire group (with a few exceptions like white supremacists). For example, I don't hate all Muslims, I hate when Muslims do bad things because of their religion (e. g. claiming that women are inferior to men)

trying my hardest to not have a fucking mental breakdown like bro bcmgf you need to stop the undeserved hate like bro i did nothing wrong

I am more mature than Hexagon, also fuck him because he doxxed me ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–• (the difference is he denies doxxing me, but when I doxxed Blue I realized my mistake in just one day and deleted the comment, why does Blue still give me shit about it but deny that Hexagon did anything wrong?)
