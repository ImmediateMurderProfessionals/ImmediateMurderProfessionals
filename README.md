Hi! I am BombCraft, and this is my unfinished README.md/bio!

Days until I become old enough to have sex in Germany: 32

Days until my stupid ass IP ban on Scratch that I don't deserve expires: 399

Days until my even stupider HTS ban that I only kinda deserve expires: 70

I plan to start modding Cookie Clicker (I actually suck ass at JS, but I am good at pattern recognition which I could prob use to add new upgrades and achievements and shit like that)

"One of the worst things you can do, even worse than rape or mutilation or shit like that, is leave this world behind. Really, the only worse thing you can do is remove someone else from this world. It's very unfortunate that all of us are going to end up having to leave this world behind someday, because again, leaving this world is the second worst thing you can do." -BombCraft, 2024

"I'll have the Neapolitan Cappuccino, more cappu than ccino, make sure it has no more than 4 ounces of milk, the beans won't have the right texture otherwise, and make sure that they spell my name correctly on the cup. They always put foxy or roxy, I hate that. *BREATH* If you can't handle that, I'll have a Venti Traditional Misto, please use soy milk with 2 blonde shots of Affrogato AND Ristretto! I'd also love 3 Vanilla pumps at the very bottom then, add the coffee after. then-" -Moxxie "Possum" Knolastname, 2021
