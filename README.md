"One of the worst things you can do, even worse than rape or mutilation or shit like that, is leave this world behind. Really, the only worse thing you can do is remove someone else from this world.

"I'll have the Neapolitan Cappuccino, more cappu than ccino, make sure it has no more than 4 ounces of milk, the beans won't have the right texture otherwise, and make sure that they spell my name correctly on the cup.
