"Sure! I like doing anything!" -Serial Designation N, 2021

"One of the worst things you can do, even worse than rape or mutilation or shit like that, is leave this world behind. Really, the only worse thing you can do is remove someone else from this world. It's very unfortunate that all of us are going to end up having to leave this world behind someday, because again, leaving this world is the second worst thing you can do." -BombCraft, 2024

"I play chess for fun, and just hope that I donâ€™t blunder because that would be disastrous..." -BCMGF1137/19themarketableplushie, 2023

"I'll have the Neapolitan Cappuccino, more cappu than ccino, make sure it has no more than 4 ounces of milk, the beans won't have the right texture otherwise, and make sure that they spell my name correctly on the cup. They always put foxy or roxy, I hate that. *BREATH* If you can't handle that, I'll have a Venti Traditional Misto, please use soy milk with 2 blonde shots of Affrogato AND Ristretto! I'd also love 3 Vanilla pumps at the very bottom then, add the coffee after. then-" -Moxxie "Possum" Knolastname, 2021
