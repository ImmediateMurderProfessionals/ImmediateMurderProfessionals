I'm lambdascorpii (formerly known as BombCraft)

15 | he/any | autistic | silly bisexual cat | gd creator, 5 creator points

If you need to contact me for anything, email me at bombcraft2010@gmail.com or send me a message on Discord (my Discord username is "lambdascorpii."). I also take GD level requests on Discord, but I can't guarantee that your level will be sent to mods, since I am not a mod and I don't have many connections with mods.

If you have a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, my friend code is SW-2753-1792-8503. I'll add my Pokemon Go friend code later.

You can also find me on Splatoon 3 as BombCraftâ™ª#2777.

DO NOT USE ANY OF MY WORK TO TRAIN AI!!!



Discord server link coming soon too.
